blablabla :)

```markdown
The Click and Collect 1H project allowed customer to order his products on the store stock, and to be delivered in his store.
The order will be prepared directly by InStore team member with the InStore application.

This documentation deals about the C&C 1H workflow:
- with a specific express checkout
- with creating a multi-items order from cube checkout.
```
